You are stuck in a music loop. But soon you realize that your self from the previous loop keeps appearing.

A game jam project for Mini Jam 113 with the theme of 'Final Boss' and the limitation of 'Stuck in a loop'.
Key idea is that you have to cooperate with your previous self to beat the boss.
Made with Unity within three days of development time.
